# Credit_Risk_Analysis
In this project, we use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Using credit card data, we oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, using the SMOTEEN algorithm we use a combination approach of over and under sampling. Finally, we compare the two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk and make a recommendation on whether these models should be used to predict the credit risk.
